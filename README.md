# Predicting liver cytosol stability of small  molecules

Over the last few decades, chemists have become increasingly proficient at designing compounds that are able to circumvent cytochrome P (CYP) 450 mediated clearance. This has led to the emergence of other drug metabolizing enzymes such as esterases, aldehyde oxidase, etc. as significant contributors to drug clearance [1]. Typical screening assays are performed in liver microsomal fractions as they contain the CYP450 enzymes and it is possible to overlook the contribution
